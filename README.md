# Sydney Java Meet-Up 20 - Microservices Transformation - a cautionary tale?
For this month's Java Meetup we're exploring Java microservices and search APIs!

John Murphy will be giving us some insights into their microservices transformation.

Luke Thompson will build a search API using MongoDB Atlas Search, and its underlying Lucene indexing technology.

Everything coded in the session will be contributed to the Sydney Java Meetup GitHub (so there's no need to make copious notes):
